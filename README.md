# Ruby Blocks

Where could you use blocks to remove duplication and/or make code more expressive?

Where could you write more compact code by using built-in Enumerable methods?

Of the four block patterns we looked at—execute around, toggle around, block initialization, and resource management—which technique(s) could you apply to make your code more flexible and easier to use?

Do you have a container class that could benefit from an each method or another iterator method?

Read through the code of your favorite Ruby gem and identify where certain blocks, iterators, or design patterns are used.

Search for each, yield, and block_given? within the code base of other projects in your company to find examples of blocks.

Get involved in a Ruby project on GitHub that you have a vested interest in improving or understanding.
